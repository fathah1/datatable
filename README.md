# creating a basic table which fetches data from the api and displays it

## Things Learned/relearned while creating this app
* brushed up on react hooks 
* learning css absolutes and relative positions again
* learning to use bootstrap and tailwind better 
* exposure to react motion framer libraries for animation 
* css grid use for layout of the website
* transform in css
* making searches and filtering in react 
* could use https://lottiefiles.com/ for animations

## Things to fix
* using multiple filters at once 
* starts with equivalent for filters for smoother search
* figure out how to make purchase details elements as one element
* fix objects with ledgerID not rendring first and later rendering or refresh or adding deleting filter


## new concepts learned while looking at the main teams code
* use __react fragments__ to create a single component from which others can be called without returning it to avoid error
* using material ui tables for easy tables that are collapsable
* using redux toolkit and making stores which can make states available for all components and called from app component
